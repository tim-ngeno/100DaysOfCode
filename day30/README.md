# Password Manager with Enhanced Error Handling and JSON Integration

## Introduction

Welcome to the enhanced version of the Password Manager application, now equipped with advanced error handling and seamless integration of JSON for efficient password data storage and retrieval.

## Features

### Password Generator
- Generates strong and randomized passwords.
- Utilizes a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
- Allows users to copy generated passwords to the clipboard.

### Password Storage
- Saves password details in a JSON file for structured and easy retrieval.
- Prompts users to confirm before saving details.

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling to enhance user experience and provide meaningful feedback.
- Covers various scenarios, including invalid inputs, file-related errors, and JSON parsing issues.

### Exception Handling

#### Invalid Inputs
- Handles scenarios where invalid inputs are provided for website, email, or password.
- Displays a user-friendly error message in the GUI.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    website = website_entry.get()
    if not website:
        raise ValueError("Website cannot be empty.")
except ValueError as ve:
    print(f"Error: {ve}")
```

In this example, if the `website` entry is empty, a `ValueError` is raised, and the control is transferred to the `except` block. The error message is then printed.

#### File-related Errors
- Catches errors related to file operations, such as file not found or permission issues.
- Provides informative error messages for users.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    with open('nonexistent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found. Please check the file path.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Error: Permission denied. Please check file permissions.")
```

Here, if the file specified does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is caught. If there are permission issues, a `PermissionError` is caught, and appropriate error messages are displayed.

### JSON Handling

#### Saving as JSON
- Implements `json.dumps()` and `json.dump()` for converting Python objects to JSON format and saving them to a file.
- Handles errors during the saving process and informs the user.

**Example:**
```python
import json

data = {"username": "john_doe", "password": "secretpassword"}

try:
    # Convert Python dictionary to JSON and save to a file
    with open('data.json', 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(data, json_file)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, the `json.dump()` function is used to save a Python dictionary as JSON. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs during the process, or if the file is not found, the control is transferred to the `except` block, and an error message is printed.

#### Retrieval from JSON
- Implements `json.loads()` and `json.load()` for reading JSON data and converting it back to Python objects.
- Ensures proper error handling during the retrieval process.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    # Read JSON data from a file and convert it to a Python dictionary
    with open('data.json', 'r') as json_file:
        loaded_data = json.load(json_file)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, the `json.load()` function is used to read JSON data from a file and convert it back to a Python dictionary. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs during the process, or if the file is not found, the control is transferred to the `except` block, and an error message is printed.
