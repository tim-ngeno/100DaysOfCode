# #######   THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS #######

# PEMDAS
# Parentheses - ()
# Exponents - **
# Multiplication - *
# Division - /
# Addition - +
# Subtraction - -


# in python:

# ()
# **
# * or /
# + or -

# In Python programming, division and multiplication
# are equally important, and the same goes for addition and subtraction

# When there are multiple operations to be performed on a single line
# of code, precedence will be given to the operation at the farthest left

#  IMPORTANT => CALCULATION GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT


# print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)


# Change the code to get a '3'
print(3 + 3 - 3 / 3 * 3)
