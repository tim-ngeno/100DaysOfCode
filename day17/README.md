# day17 - Object Oriented Programming
## Creating custom classes
In this we create custom classes, with attributes and methods and constructors

An attribute is variable attached to a class object, a method is a function that is defined within a class, and is only accessible within that class

A constructor is defined by using a special dunder method, `__init__()`

The init function is where we initialize, or create the starting values of an object created from the class. It is important to note that the constructor will be called for every object of the class.
